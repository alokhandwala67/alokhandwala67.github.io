  <h1>Modular expressions for finding an approximations to inverse product of primes</h1>
<p><strong><em>May 13th, 2019</em> by Aziz Lokhandwala</strong></p>
<h2>Many works have been done related to prime numbers, but still we do not have any information regarding product of Primes or say product of inverse primes.And yeah don't try to corelate this with divisors of a number.</h2>

<p>I am not able to prove this work but based on empirical observations I have found two equations regarding product of inverse primes and I can gurantee that equations more accurate than these two equations are not possible, and if you find one just text me at <li>perkanulla@gmail.com</li>.
$${1 \over {2*3*5*7*11*13*...}} = {lnx \over x^x} - {x*ln(ln...xtimes) \over 10^x}$$
$${1 \over {2*3*5*7*11*13*...}} = {lnx \over x^x} {(1 -  {1 \over P(x)})}$$
    Here,</p>
    <p><em>x = number of primes upto which you want to multiply them,</em></p>
    <p><em>P(x) = xth prime number</em></p>
<p>If anyone find a proof for this please mail me at
